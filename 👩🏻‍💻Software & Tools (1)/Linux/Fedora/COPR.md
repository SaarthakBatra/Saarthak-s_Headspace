**COPR** (Cool Other Package Repo) is a collection of personal package repositories hosted by the Fedora Project. It works similarly to the AUR (Arch User Repository) but for Fedora/RHEL.
### Is it safe?
*   COPR is **not officially supported** or quality-assured by Red Hat/Fedora. It is community-maintained.
*   It is generally considered safe for common tools like  `appimagelauncher`, but you should always be aware that you are installing software from a community member, not the core Fedora team.
