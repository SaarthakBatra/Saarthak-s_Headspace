---
- Based on Nanofilm's BAM1
- Uses the imaging ellipsometer platform - ep3, to enable the upgradability to a complete imaging ellipsometer
- The nanofilm_ep3bam software toolbox includes a special image processing tool and an integrated solution for quantitative analytical Brewster Angle Microscopy

## About
### Applications
- Monolayer phases
- Domains and order phenomena
- Transformation of monolayer into multilayered structures
- Photochemical reactions e.g., photoisomerization
- LB-films on solid structures
- Influences of various subphase compositions(counter ions) on monolayer structures
- Polymers and other materials that cannot be detected by fluorescence microscopy
- Adsorption kinetics
- In-situ polymerization in monolayers
- Phase separation
- Quality and homogeneity of LB-films

### Features
• Real time contrast image
• Automatic Z tracking to follow changing water levels
• AVI recorder to create AVI videos during experiments
• Scripting language EP3 Script for automation, eg. automatic recording of images at predefined time intervals
• Analysis tools for analytical BAM (film thickness measurements by BAM)
• Remote control of the instrument possible due to LAN connection for application support or the use in a closed environment
• Software interface to NIMA or KSV and the new KSVNIMA troughs

### Benefits
• Highest lateral resolution in the field of Brewster Angle Microscopy
• Real time imaging: direct visualization of your sample – you see what you are doing
• BAM tools offering quantitative BAM, level control and powerful background correction tools
• As a unique feature of the Accurion goniometer design, there are no bearings or mechanical mounts in the axis of rotation => free space for even large LB-troughs or space consuming samples
