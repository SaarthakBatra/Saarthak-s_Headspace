- Brewster angle microscope (BAM) with quasi-elastic light
scattering (QELS) setup.
- The sample cell has three glass windows: 
	- a window for the incident inplane polarized Coherent Compass 315M Nd-YAG 532 nm laser at the Brewster angle
	- a window for the reflected image of the interface to be recorded by a Mightex MCE-B013-UW CMOS camera
	- a window for light transmitted through the interface to be recorded by a photodiode for QELS measurement. 
- The camera exposure is adjusted by changing the shutter speed for each magnification of the focusing optics. 
- An analyzer is installed directly before the camera to reveal surface anisotropy. 
- When QELS measurements are made, a beam expander, grating, neutral density filter and neighboring achromatic doublet lenses are placed between the sample cell and the incident laser to image the external grating onto the interface. 
- The grating acts as a local oscillator for heterodyne detection, part of the QELS technique.
- These additional components are swapped out for BAM imaging.

## Features
- Sample cell cleanliness and material purity are critical for these experiments. Slightly impure samples exhibit lower interfacial tension, a lower transition temperature, clusters that are much larger and less faceted, and absence of the stripe phase.
- The sample liquids are contained in a hermetically sealed Teflon coated aluminum cell, which is encased in a cylindrical aluminum thermostat to control the temperature
- The sample cell and optical setup shown in Fig. allow for sequential Brewster angle microscopy to image surfactant domains and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) to measure interfacial tension.
- The reection of p-polarized light at the Brewster angle would be extinguished from an ideal, stepfunction dielectric interface, but deviations from ideality due to the presence, e.g., of monolayer domains, lead to weak relections that are used to image the interfacial phase morphology
- Since the camera is at an oblique angle to the interface, only a fraction of the total feld of view is in focus at one time. To account for this, 10 to 50 images are captured while the focus is scanned across the surface. 
- The images are digitally pieced together in imageJ software for a single composite in-focus image. 
- The image is electronically stretched to the surface's true aspect ratio to correct for the distorted aspect ratio from the camera's oblique viewing angle. 
- For visual clarity, each image is separately contrast enhanced by linearly scaling the histogram of captured pixel values to span the full range of possible pixel values. Images are recorded at one of two magnifications – $17.4\times$ and $3\times$ – with a horizontal feld of view of $380 \mu m$ and $2.25 mm$, respectively. 
- The $3\times$ images occasionally exhibit narrow horizontal bands along the top edge as a result of optical interference from the microscope and should not be regarded as part of the liquid surface structure. 
- The $3\times$ images additionally exhibit a pronounced gradient of laser illumination with enhanced brightness in the image center that represents the shape of the laser beam
