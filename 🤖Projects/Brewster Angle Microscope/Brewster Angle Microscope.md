- A Brewster angle microscope (BAM) is a microscope for studying thin films on liquid surfaces, most typically Langmuir films. 
- In a Brewster angle microscope, both the microscope and a polarized light source are aimed towards a liquid surface at that liquid's Brewster angle, in such a way for the microscope to catch an image of any light reflected from the light source via the liquid surface. 
- Because there is no p-polarized reflection from the pure liquid when both are angled towards it at the Brewster angle, light is only reflected when some other phenomenon such as a surface film affects the liquid surface. 
- The technique was first introduced in 1991.

## Working
1. The operation of the BAM is based on the well-known fact that, for a pure Fresnel interface, the reflectivity of the in-plane polarization component becomes zero at the Brewster angle
2. When a surface of, e.g., pure water, which is an almost pure Fresnel interface, is illuminated under the Brester angle with monochromatic p-polarized light, the reflectivity can be as low as $10^{-7}$; i.e., it will appear dark.
3. The reflectivity is not exactly zero because of some surface roughness caused by capillary waves.
4. The presence of very small amounts of material on the water surface will affect the Brewster condition so that (in most cases) the reflectivity goes up. Regions differing in density or orientation of molecules on the surface will therefore show up by virtue of their optical contrast.
5. One problem inherent to the BAM is that the surface must be viewed under an angle. In a conventional linear arrangement of the viewing optics, it is then impossible to focus simultaneously on the entire area of interest.
6. Moreover, viewing under an angle obviously yields images compressed along the line of sight. Meunier solved these problems by confocal scanning of the area of interest, retaining only narrow strips around the focal line
