- Applied load W is in the same plane to the bolts
- $G$ is the centre of gravity of the group of bolts
- Force P at CoG results in primary shear forces $F_{s_1}$ 
- Moment of P at CoG results in secondary shear forces $F_{s_2}$

## Primary Load
- Direct Shear Load
- Without considering eccentricity (e), assume load acts directly on the bolt
- Primary Load (Shear): 
	$F_{s_1} = \frac{W}{n}$
	where
	$W$ = Total applied load
	n = Total number of bolts

## Secondary Load
- Torsional Shear Load
- Considering the eccentricity (distance of load from bolt)
- Tries to rotate assembly about pivot point
- Center of assembly is **Pivot Point**
- Secondary Load(Shear): 
	$F_{s_2} = \frac{We}{nr}$
	where
	$W$ = Total Load
	e = Distance of applied load from pivot point
	$r$ = Distance of bolt from pivot point
	n = number of bolts

## Equivalent Shear Load - $F_{s_{eq}} = \sqrt{F_{s_1}^2 + F_{s_2}^2 + 2F_{s_1}F_{s_2}cos\theta}$
