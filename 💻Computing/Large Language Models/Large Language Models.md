- A neural network basically tries to predict the next word in a given sequence of words
## Stages of Training a model
1. Pre-training
	- Produces a document generator 
	- High hallucinations 
2. Fine tuning
	- Produces an asistant model
	- Requires labeled information 
	- Aligns the output of model in the correct direction
3. Optional more fine tuning
	- Uses comparison of multiple generated outputs to fine tune the model
## Components 
A large language model just has two files
1. Parameters 
    -  Weights/Parameters of the neural network 
    - Can be as large as hundreds of GBs
    - Created during the training phase of model
    - Raw data → Training → Compiled parameters for the model (lossy compressed raw data)
    - Extremely computationally demanding and expensive process
2. Code for running
	- Computationally cheap process
