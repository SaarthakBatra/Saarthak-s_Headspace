- A fillet / lap joint, is a joint between two overlapping plates
## Types of Fillet Joints
1. Transverse Fillet Joint
	- Direction of the weld is perpendicular to the direction of the force acting on the joint. 
	- A single transverse fillet joint is not preferred because the edge of the plate, which is not welded, can warp out of shape
	- A double transverse fillet weld, as shown is preferred. 
2. Parallel Fillet Joint 
	- Direction of weld is parallel to the direction of the force acting on the joint
