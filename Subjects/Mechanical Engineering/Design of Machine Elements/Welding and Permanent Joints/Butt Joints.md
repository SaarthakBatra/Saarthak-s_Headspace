- A joint between two components lying in the same plane.

## Strength of Butt Weld
![[Butt Joints-butt weld in tension.png#align-right|Butt Weld under Tension|400]]
A butt welded joint, subjected to tensile force P having an average tensile stress $\sigma_t$ has relation ,
$$P = \sigma_ttl\eta\ \ (N/mm^2)$$
where, 
	$P$ = Tensile force on plates ($N$)
	$t$ = throat of the weld, generally thickness of plate ($mm$)
	$l$ = length of weld ($mm$)
	$\eta$ = efficiency of welded joint in fraction, generally taken 1
