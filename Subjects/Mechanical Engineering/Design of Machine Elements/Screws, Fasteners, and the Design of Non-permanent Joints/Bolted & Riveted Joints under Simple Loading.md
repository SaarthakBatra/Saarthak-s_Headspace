A bolted joint subjected to tensile force P is shown in Fig.
![[Bolted & Riveted Joints under Simple Loading - Bolt in tension.png#align-right]]
- Cross-section at core diameter $d_c$ is the weakest section
- Maximum tensile stress in bolt at this cross-section follows the relation,
$$P = \frac{\pi}{4}d_c^2\sigma_t$$
where,
$$\sigma_t = \frac{S_{yt}}{fs}$$
- Maximum shear stress on bolt for shear area $\pi d_c h$ follows relation,
$$P = \pi d_c h [\frac{S_{sy}}{fs}]= \pi d_c h [\frac{S_{yt}}{2fs}]$$
where
	$h$ = height of nut
	$S_{sy}$ = Yield strength in shear
	$S_{yt}$ = Yield strength in tension
	we assume that $S_{sy} = 0.5 S_{yt}$

- For standard coarse threads, the threads are equally strong in failure by shear and failure by tension, if the height of the nut is approximately 0.4 times of the nominal diameter of the bolt i.e 
	$h = 0.4d$ assuming $d_c = 0.8d$
- For a standard hexagonal nut,
	$h = 0.8d$
