![[Perpendicular to axis of bolts.png]]
- Applied load W is perpendicular to the axis passing through the center of the bolts and acting in a different plane than the bolts
- Force P results in direct shear force ($F_s$) on the bolts
- Moment of P tends to tilt bracket about edge C, resulting in tensile forces $F_t$
- Bolt located at farthest distance from the tilting edge C, is subjected to maximum force.
## Primary Load
- Direct Shear Load
- Without considering eccentricity (d), assume load acts directly on the bolt
- Primary Load (Shear): 
	$F_{s} = \frac{W}{n}$
	where
	$W$ = Total applied load
	n = Total number of bolts

## Secondary Load
- Tensile Load
- Considering the eccentricity (distance of load from bolt)
- Tries to rotate assembly about pivot point
- Point C is **Pivot Point**
- Secondary Load(Tensile): 
	$F_{t} = W_{max} = \frac{(Wl)l_{max}}{\sum_i^nl_i^2}$
	where
	$W_{max}$ = Maximum Load on a bolt
	$W$ = Total Load
	l = Distance of applied load from pivot point
	$l_{max}$ = Maximum length of a bolt from pivot point
	$l_i$ = Distance of bolt $i$ from pivot point
	n = number of bolts

## Equivalent Tensile Load - $F_{t_{eq}} = \frac{1}{2}[\ F_t + \sqrt{F_t^2 + 4F_s^2}\ ]$

## Equivalent Shear Load - $F_{s_{eq}} = \frac{1}{2}[\ \sqrt{F_t^2 + 4F_s^2}\ ]$
