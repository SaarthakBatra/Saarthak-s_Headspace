---
- Product layout arranges machines or workers in a line according to the sequence of operations that need to be performed to assemble a particular product. 
- To attain the required output rate as efficiently as possible, jobs are broken down into their smallest indivisible portions, called **work elements**.
- Part of the layout decision is concerned with grouping these work elements into workstations so products flow through the assembly line smoothly.
## Designing Product Layouts
1. [[Line Balancing]]
## Cellular Layout
- To combine the flexibility of a process layout with the efficiency of a product layout.
- Uses the concept of group technology (GT), in which similar parts are identified and grouped together to take advantage of their similarities in production.
- Dissimilar machines or activities are grouped into cells, to process families of parts with similar requirements. 
- The cells are arranged in relation to each other so that material movement is minimized.
