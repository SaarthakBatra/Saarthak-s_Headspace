Integrating quantity discounts in EOQ

## Assumptions
1. Only one product is involved (one SKU(stock keeping unit))
2. Demand is known and independent of decisions for other items
3. Usage rate is constant
4. Usage is a continuous process while production is a periodical process
5. Production rate is constant
6. Lead time (time between placement and receipt of an order) is know and constant
## Model


- Order Quantity = $Q$
- Average Inventory = $\frac{Q}{2}$
- Production Rate = $p$
- Inventory Demand per period = $d$
- Cost of placing order = $C_0$
- Annual per-unit carrying cost = $C_c$
- Annual Demand = $D$
### Total Annual Cost
$$\text{Total cost} = \frac{C_0 D}{Q}+\frac{C_CI_{max}}{2}+PD$$
