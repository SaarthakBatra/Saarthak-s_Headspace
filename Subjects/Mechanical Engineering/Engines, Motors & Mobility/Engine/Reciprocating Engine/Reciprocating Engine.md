## Nomenclature

1. **Cylinder Bore $(d)$ :** 
	The nominal inner diameter of the working cylinder 
 2. **Piston Area $(A)$ :** 
	The area of a circle of diameter equal to the cylinder bore 
3. **Stroke $(L)$ :** 
	The nominal distance through which a working piston moves between two successive reversals of its direction of motion 
4. **Stroke to Bore Ratio $(L/d)$ :** 
	Classifies the size of the engine
	1. If $d<L\implies$ Under-Square Engine
	2. If $d=L\implies$ Square Engine
	3. If $d>L\implies$ Over-Square Engine 
	- An over-square engine can operate at higher speeds because of larger bore and shorter stroke 
5. **Dead Centre :** 
	The position of the working piston at the moment when the direction of the piston motion is reversed at either end of the stroke. 
	The piston reciprocates in the cylinder between two fixed positions called dead centers
	1. **Top dead center (TDC)**
		Position of piston when it forms the smallest volume in the cylinder
	2. **Bottom dead center (BDC)**
		Position of piston when it forms the largest volume in the cylinder. 
	- The distance between the TDC and the BDC is the **Stroke** or the largest distance that the piston can travel in one direction
6.  **Displacement/Swept Volume $V_s$ :**
	The volume displaced by the piston as it moves between TDC and BDC
	Expressed in terms of cubic centimeter $(cc)$
	$$V_s = \frac{\pi}{4}d^2L$$
7. **Clearance Volume $V_c$ :**
	The minimum volume formed in the cylinder when the piston is at TDC
	Expressed in terms of cubic centimeter $(cc)$
8. **Cubic/Engine Capacity :**
	$$Cubic\ Capacity = V_s\times Number\ of\ Cylinders$$
9. **Volume Ratio :**
	Ratio of larger volume to lesser volume during any process
	$$Volume Ratio = \frac{Larger Volume}{Lesser Volume}$$
10. **Compression Ratio $(r)$  :**
	The ratio of the maximum volume formed in the cylinder (at BDC) to the minimum (clearance) volume (at TDC). It is the volume ratio during compression process.
	Compression ratio is constant for an engine
	$$r=\frac{V_t}{V_c}=\frac{V_c+V_s}{V_c}$$
11. **Clearance Ratio $(C)$ :**
	Ratio of clearance volume to stroke volume
	$$C=\frac{V_c}{V_s}$$
12. **Mean Piston Speed $\overline{U_p}$ :**
	$$\overline{U_p} = \frac{2LN}{60}$$
	where,
		$L$ = Stroke
		$N$ = Rotational Speed of Crankshaft (rpm)
