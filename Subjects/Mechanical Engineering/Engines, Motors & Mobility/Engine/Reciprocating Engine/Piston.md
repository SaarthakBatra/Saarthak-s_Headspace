A piston of an internal combustion engine is in the form of an inverted bucket shape and it is free to slide in the cylinder barrel
A piston of an internal combustion engine serves three functions:
1. It forms a moveable wall of the combustion chamber.
2. It transmits turning force to the crankshaft via the connecting rod.
3. It functions like a crosshead and transmits side thrust, which is due to the angularity of the connecting rods to the cylinder walls.
